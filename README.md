## the motive

### why?

i've always felt like social platforms are too complex, sluggish, and harbor a toxic community. i made this in hopes to make hosting your own social platform -- whether it's public or private -- easier and fun!

i know you could just host a fedi instance but i made this so i could have more control and implement my own features here and there.

### when?

i started this on november 3rd iirc, and after hearing about hackclub i wanted to participate and submit this, as most other projects were simple or generic and i wanted to be "unique" i guess.
